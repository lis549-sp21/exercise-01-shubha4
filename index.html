    <p>Elizabeth is the second-youngest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.
        She is an intelligent young woman who questions the societal norms of the 1800s-England.</p>
    <p>She is a character from <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></cite>  by Jane Austen.</p>
    <h3>Reasons why I admire Elizabeth Bennet:</h3>
    <li>She is very witty and smart.</li>
    <li>She loves her family and is willing to do anything for them.</li>
    <li><span class = "highlighted">She believes that a woman's value extends beyond her ability to produce children.</span></li>
